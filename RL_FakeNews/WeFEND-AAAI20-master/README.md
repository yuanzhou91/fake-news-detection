### Data Statistics

|   |# of data   | # of fake news   |
|---|---|---|
|**train**   |  10,587<br>  |2,743<br>  |
|**test**   |10,141 <br> |1,482<br>|
|**unlabeled news**   |67,748 <br> |-<br>|


### Data Description
| Columns  |Description   | 
|---|---|
|**Official Account Name**   | The name of official account, news publisher <br>  |
|**Title**   |News Title <br> |
|**News Url**   |The url of news <br> |
|**Image Url**   |The url of cover image <br> |
|**Report Content**   |The reports from reader, split by ## <br> |
|**label**   |label of news, 0 is real and 1 is fake <br> |
 
 
 ## Main Idea
 ### Challenge: 
Due to the __dynamic nature__ of news, annotated samples may become __outdated__ quickly and cannot represent the news articles on newly emerged events. Therefore, how to obtain __fresh and
high-quality labeled samples__ is the major challenge in employing deep learning models for fake news detection.

### Solution: 
We propose a reinforced weakly supervised fake news detection framework, i.e., WeFEND,
which can __leverage users’ reports as weak supervision source__ to enlarge the amount of training data for fake news detection.

## Experiment
We aim to answer two important questions:
  * Does the distribution of news change with time?
  * why should we use the reports to annotate the fake
news?
